Creating public/private keys from the strong name .pfx file:
    //Extract the key-pair
    openssl pkcs12 -in Main.pfx -nocerts -nodes -out sample.key

    //Get the Private Key from the key-pair
    openssl rsa -in sample.key -out sample_private.key

    //Get the Public Key from key pair
    openssl rsa -in sample.key -pubout -out sample_public.key

    //Need to do some modification to the private key -> to pkcs8 format
    openssl pkcs8 -topk8 -inform PEM -in sample_private.key -outform PEM -nocrypt
    //Copy the output and save it as sample_private_pkcs8.key

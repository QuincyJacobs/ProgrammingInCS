### Project 3-3
 
To make these projects work:

Go to the Project Options > Sign(ing assmelbies) and check the box "Sign this assembly" and use your own key.
You have to do this for both the "AssemblyDependedProject" and the "AssemblyMainProject".
You can also deselect the sign option instead, but the assembly will not be strong-named anymore.
